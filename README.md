# WeatherPy and VacationPy
Who wouldn't want to quickly find the best destinations to take a vacation based on their ideal weather conditions? In this project, we look at two different notebooks:

## WeatherPy
In this notebook, we get a random list of cities from around the world and analyze the correlation between the following metrics across the nothern and southern hempispheres through a series of scatter plots and by finding the linear regression for:
- Latitude vs. Temperature
- Latitude vs. Humidity
- Latitude vs. Cloudiness
- Latitude vs. Wind Speed

## VacationPy
After we've looked at the weather, let's hone in on the idea conditions and find a place to stay! The first step is to check out a map of the humidity at each location and then find the perfect spot based on the following weather conditions: 
- Max temps between 70-80F
- Windspeeds of 10 MPH or less (I like a little breeze)
- Under 25% cloud cover

Once lodging with those condions are found, it's then plotted on a map.

The final step is to enjoy your perfect vacation!
